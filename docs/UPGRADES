UPGRADES
========

You can access the online documentation for upgrades at https://github.com/opennetadmin/ona/wiki/Upgrades

Upgrades should automatically be detected and performed.  As usual MAKE A BACKUP FIRST!
Its likely that I screwed something up and your data will be ground into a fine dust.
Currently the autoupgrade of database elements only works when using a MySQL database.

Quick steps for upgrade:

  * edit /opt/ona/www/local/config/database_settings.inc.php
    * edit the ```db_type``` setting and change it to 'mysqli' if it is not already.
  * Git pull
    * cd to /opt/ona or wherever you've installed it
    * git pull
  * (OR) Download new tar file  
    * Download the latest tar archive from https://github.com/opennetadmin/ona/archive/master.tar.gz
    * `tar --strip-components=1 -C /opt/ona -zxvf ona-master.tar.gz`  Or change -C /opt/ona to wherever your installed it to on your system
  * `chown www-data /opt/ona/www/local/config` (or whatever your web server user is)
  * Point your browser to http://localhost/ona/?runinstaller=y OR use cli installer `php /opt/ona/install/installcli.php`
    * If you do not run the upgrade installer you may run into issues.  You must execute the link above after installing the tar archive.
  * After the license info you will be informed that an upgrade will occur.  Select OK to the upgrade (after your backups n stuff)
  * If there is any new database updates they should be applied and you should see a note about the upgrade_index being updated as well as version numbers.
  * Once in, should see the latest version number displayed on the dashboard.
