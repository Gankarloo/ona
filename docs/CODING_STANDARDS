CODING STANDARDS
  Synopsis:
    * Comments are to begin with two forward slashes: //
    * Use an indent of 2 or 4 spaces, with NO TABS!
    * Functions must have a descriptive header with the name, description,
      input requirements, output, and example usage.
    * At least one command line argument is REQUIRED before a script does
      anything!
    * When no command line arguments are supplied the script should display
      a human readable usage summary.
    * The "-h" and "--help" command line options must be supported.
    * Scripts must exit with an error code of 0 on success, and non-zero
      on error.

  Misc:
    * Put the phrase "FIXME: " near areas that need future work.
    * Put the phrase "BUSINESS RULE: " before comments that describe business
      rules.  Example: in subnet_del we put "BUSINESS RULE:" near the comments
      describing the fact that when deleting subnets we automatically delete
      interfaces from hosts that also have interfaces in other subnets, but
      we delete the host if it only has one interface, and it's on this subnet.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES


USE OF THE $_SESSION VARIABLE
    * Everything is stored "under" $_SESSION['ona']
    * All authentication  and user data is stored under $_SESSION['ona']['auth']
        When a user logs out, only $_SESSION['ona']['auth'] is deleted.
    *
