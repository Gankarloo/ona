Contributing
------------

Thank you for taking the time to look at this. Any help we can get from the
community is much appreciated and helps the project move forward.

OpenNetAdmin uses the Gitflow workflow. More info here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow

I'm not going to go into a huge description of the process here. The easiest way for others
to contribute is to use a forking workflow.

Some good info on those workflows are here:
  * https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/
  * https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/
  * https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow

Then once you have new code checked into your repo fork, submit a pull request for consideration.

Thanks again for your participation.
